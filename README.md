[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sysen-limited/angular-toolbelt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sysen-limited/angular-toolbelt)

### Documentation

To use this project checkout the [online documentation](http://toolbelt.sysen.co.uk).

### Quick Overview

To use this project there are **no dependencies** on anything other than Angular, however to get the most out of the UI elements we have chosen bootstrap for any templates which can be overridden.

This toolbelt has been created as they offer useful add-ons to the angular environment which can solve common interactions or UI needs

The following helpers have been made or are coming soon for building rich applications with angular

Available:
- Growl (show dynamically messages on your interface)
- Scroll (automatic scrolling on a page to take users to a set anchor location, but via a jump or animation)

In Development:
- Slider
- File Upload
- Infinite Scroll

Future:
- CRUD Service
